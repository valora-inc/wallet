# Connecting Dapps

Valora supports [WalletConnect
v1](https://docs.walletconnect.com/1.0/) for connecting Dapps to
Valora.

If you're building a Dapp we recommend
[react-celo](https://github.com/celo-org/react-celo) to make it easy
to connect your Dapp to Valora via WalletConnect. [cLabs](https://clabs.co/) supports
react-celo and it includes a complete example to help you get started.
