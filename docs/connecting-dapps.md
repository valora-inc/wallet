# Connecting Dapps

Valora supports [WalletConnect v2](https://docs.walletconnect.com/2.0/) for connecting Dapps to Valora. [WalletConnect v1 is end-of-life](https://docs.walletconnect.com/2.0/advanced/migration-from-v1.x/overview) and not supported.

If you're building a Dapp we recommend [rainbowkit](https://github.com/rainbow-me/rainbowkit) or [Web3Modal](https://github.com/WalletConnect/web3modal) to make it easy to connect your Dapp to Valora via WalletConnect. Take a look at a [complete example](https://docs.celo.org/developer/rainbowkit-celo) to help you get started.

## Troubleshooting tips

When building the connection between your Dapp and Valora, it can be challenging to determine the source of a connection error. We recommend using the official WalletConnect example Dapp and wallet to help with this.

- If Valora cannot connect to your Dapp but is able to connect to the [WalletConnect v2 example react Dapp](https://react-app.walletconnect.com/) correctly, the issue likely lies with your Dapp. It can be helpful to check the [implementation details](https://github.com/WalletConnect/web-examples/tree/main/dapps/react-dapp-v2) of this example Dapp against your own implementation.
- If your Dapp is unable to connect to the [WalletConnect v2 example wallet](https://react-wallet.walletconnect.com/), there is likely an issue with your Dapp. As above, we recommend comparing the implementation details between your Dapp and the example Dapp provided.
