# Registering Tokens with Users

> This feature is in-development and not fully supported yet!

Valora includes a default list of popular tokens. Each token in the
default list must meet the asset listing <a href={props.assetGuidelines}>requirements</a>.
However, there are many tokens that users
want to manage and transact with in Valora that do not meet the requirements. To
support these tokens well, Valora implements a deeplink handler so
that a dapp can construct deeplinks that make it easy for their users
to add arbitrary tokens to Valora.

## Using deeplinks

> This feature is in-development and not fully supported yet!

Valora's deeplink handler requires the contract address. If your
ERC-20 contract supports
[EIP-1046](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-1046.md),
Valora will fetch the token symbol, decimals, and image from the token
metadata. If your ERC-20 contract does not support EIP-1046 you must
specify symbol, decimals, and optionally image in the deeplink. You
can also override the image specified in an EIP-1046 compliant
contract.

```ts
// Required: The address that the token is at
const address = '0xb92463e2262e700e29c16416270c9fdfa17934d7'
// Required if non-EIP-1046 compliant: a ticker symbol or shorthand, up to 5 chars.
const symbol = 'C4P'
// Required if non-EIP-1046 compliant: the number of decimals in the token
const decimals = 6
// Optional: a URL to download token image (must be a 256 x 256 PNG)
const image = 'https://should-not-resolve.foo/256x256.png'

const watchAssetDeeplink = `valora://wallet/watchAsset?address=${address}&symbol=${symbol}&decimals=${decimals}&image=${encodeURIComponent(image)}`
```

## Upcoming: using EIP-747

> This feature is planned and will be supported soon!

Valora aims to support
[EIP-747](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-747.md)
to make it easy for dapp integrated with MetaMask's watch token
functionality to also support Valora.
