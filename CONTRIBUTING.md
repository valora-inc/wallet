# Contributing

Valora is open source and we welcome open participation!

## Contributing PRs

Find an area that is of interest and you would like to help with. Look
for issues that are tagged as "[good first
issue](https://github.com/valora-inc/wallet/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22)"
or "[help
wanted](https://github.com/valora-inc/wallet/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22help+wanted%22)"
to get started. If you’d like to dig deeper, feel free to look at
other labels and TODO’s in code comments. If there’s an issue you’re
interested in contributing to or taking over, assign yourself to it
and add a comment with your plans to address and target timeline. If
there’s already someone assigned to it, please check with them before
adding yourself to the assignee list.

Tasks range from minor to major improvements. Based on your interests,
skillset, and level of comfort with the code-base feel free to
contribute where you see appropriate. We encourage you to PR \(pull
request\) your work regularly and often to solicit feedback and to
ensure everyone has an idea of what you’re working on. If you’ve just
started, we suggest creating a PR with “WIP” \(Work In Progress\) in
the title and let us know when it’s ready to review in the comments.

### Contributing _substantial_ changes

A substantial change is one that significantly alters the user
experience or an underlying implementation. For example, we would
consider the following as examples of substantial changes:

- Adding support for in-app swaps.
- Changing how Valora calculates asset value in local fiat.
- Changing Valora's branding (_e.g.,_ color palette).
- Adding a way for Valora users to go through decentralized KYC.
- Removing screens from onboarding.

If you're considering making what might be a substantial change, we
strongly encourage you to reach out to the Valora engineering team
first. We might have suggestions that guide the implementation and
make it easier to implement a high-quality change to Valora with the
least amount of work. `#valora-dev` on Valora's [Discord
server](./README.md#community) is a great way to contact us.
